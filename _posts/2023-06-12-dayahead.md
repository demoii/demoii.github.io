Granular Day Ahead Electricity Prices for France and Interconnections


## About Dataset
This dataset provides hourly day ahead electricity prices for France and interconnections, sourced from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, which is a reputable market data provider for European electricity markets. It is valuable resource for businesses, investors, researchers, and energy consumers interested in analyzing and understanding the dynamics of the electricity market with a high level of granularity.

### What are Day Ahead Electricity Prices ?

Electricity day ahead prices refer to the prices at which electricity is bought and sold in the wholesale market for delivery the next day. These prices are determined through a process called day-ahead market (DAM) auctions, where electricity generators and suppliers submit bids and offers for the electricity they are willing to buy or sell for delivery the following day.

The day ahead prices are typically based on various factors such as supply and demand conditions, availability of generation sources (such as renewable energy, nuclear, or fossil fuel), weather conditions, and transmission constraints. These prices are determined through a competitive bidding process, where participants submit their bids and offers based on their expected costs and revenues.

Electricity day ahead prices are important because they serve as a reference for pricing electricity contracts, setting wholesale electricity prices, and managing electricity supply and demand on a daily basis. They also influence retail electricity prices, as they can impact the cost of electricity for end consumers. In some regions, day ahead prices may also be used as a benchmark for other timeframes, such as intraday or real-time prices, which reflect more immediate changes in supply and demand.

Understanding day ahead prices can be useful for electricity market participants, policymakers, and consumers to make informed decisions about their electricity usage, pricing strategies, and investment in electricity generation and consumption technologies

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes historical and forecasted day ahead (DAH) electricity prices for France and interconnections (Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium). The data is presented at an hourly granularity, covering a specific timeframe, and includes information such as hourly electricity prices in Euros per MWh (Megawatt-hour), date, time.

The dataset is presented in a structured format, such as CSV or Excel, making it easy to manipulate and analyze using various data analysis tools and techniques. It is ideal for conducting research, building predictive models, or gaining insights into the day ahead electricity prices for France and interconnections at an hourly level.

### Use Case Examples

- Developing hourly price forecasting models for France using machine learning algorithms (Deep Learning, Regressions, Random Forests)
- Analyzing the impact of cross-border electricity trading on hourly prices (EDA)
- Studying historical hourly trends and patterns in electricity prices for France (Time Series Analysis, LSTM)
- Building energy pricing models for business planning and strategy with hourly granularity
- Conducting research on hourly energy market dynamics and trends

### Study hourly trends and patterns in eletricity prices for France
Each day therea re usually two peaks, one in early morning and one around dinner time. 


```python
# check if there is a daily pattern over different day of a week 
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))

major_ticks = np.arange(0, 23, 2)

ax = sns.lineplot(x="hour", y="france",
             hue="weekday", 
             data= df)

ax.set_xticks(major_ticks);
```

#              hue="weekday", 
#              data= df)

g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="weekday",  row="month", sharey=False)
g.map_dataframe(sns.lineplot, x="hour", y = "france")
